# NxStarter - NNN (Next, Nest, NX)

Stack:

- Next
- Nest
- Prisma

Key features:

- _GH actions_ with linting, building and auto deploy to AWS
- _Docker compose_ with postgres and pgAdmin for dev
- TS-Rest for _end-to-end type-safety_ and auto generated _swagger_
- _Shared package_ for reusable code between packages
- Pre-configured _tailwind_
- Next with _Server Components_
- No JS only TS

Prerequisites:

- NodeJS 20+
- Pnpm 7+
- Docker with docker compose

First start:

1. Run `pnpm i` to install dependencies
2. Prepare env files. I created .env.example with default envs
3. Run `docker compose up`. If you have your db, than you can skip it, but then do not forget to change `DATABASE_URL` in `packages/db` env
4. Run `pnpm nx run api:serve` to start api
5. Run `pnpm nx run web:serve` to start web

Blocked features:

1. Aliases inside apps<br>
    Reasons:
    - tsconfigs paths do not combine, so if I will add aliases, then root aliases will be removed
2. Swagger with auth protections routes<br>
    Reasons:
    - TSRest autogenerated swagger do not support this feature for now

TODO:

1. SWC?
